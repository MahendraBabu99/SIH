Windows Timeline database tracking application focus time and user activity.
- Provides a timeline of what applications the user was actively working in, with timestamps.
- Suspicious: remote access tool usage, cloud storage clients during off-hours, admin utilities not part of the user's normal role, sensitive document access patterns.
- Context value: establishes what the user was doing before, during, and after suspicious events detected in other artifacts.
- Cross-check: correlate with execution artifacts and browser history to build a complete activity narrative.
