# AIFT - AI Forensic Triage V1.5

**Automated Windows and Linux forensic triage, powered by AI.**

AIFT turns hours of manual artifact analysis into minutes. Upload one or more disk images, select what to parse, and get an AI-generated forensic report - all from your browser, all running locally on your machine. Supports both Windows and Linux disk images, and can correlate findings across multiple systems in a single case.

Built for incident responders who need fast answers, and simple enough for non-forensic team members to operate.

**This project is under active development. Contributions are welcome. If you run into any bugs, let me know!**

---

## How It Works

```
Upload Evidence → Select Artifacts → Parse → AI Analysis → HTML Report
```

1. **Run the app** - a local web interface opens in your browser.
2. **Upload evidence** - drag-and-drop an E01, VMDK, VHD, raw image, or archive, or point to a local path for large images. Add multiple images to a single case for cross-system analysis.
3. **Pick artifacts** - choose from 25+ Windows or 19 Linux forensic artifacts per image, which will be parsed by [Dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect).
4. **Get results** - AI analyzes each artifact for indicators of compromise, correlates findings across artifacts and across systems, and generates a self-contained HTML report with evidence hashes and full audit trail.

No Elasticsearch. No Docker. No database. One Python script, one command.

## Example Reports

A [publicly available test image](https://cfreds.nist.gov/all/BenjaminDonnachie/CompromisedWindowsServer2022simulation) (Compromised Windows Server 2022 Simulation by Benjamin Donnachie, NIST CFReDS) was used to compare AI providers. The analysis prompt included one real IOC (`PsExec`) and one not observed IOC (`redpetya.exe`) to test each model's ability to identify true findings and avoid false positives.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlipForensics/AIFT.git
cd aift
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10-3.13 is required. All dependencies are pure Python - no C libraries, no system packages.
Python 3.14+ is currently unsupported due to upstream `dissect.target` compatibility.

### 2. Run

```bash
python aift.py
```

The app starts and opens your browser to `http://localhost:5000`. On first run, a default `config.yaml` is created automatically.

### 3. Configure your AI provider

Click the **gear icon** (⚙) in the top-right corner of the UI. Select your AI provider and enter the required credentials:

- For **Claude** or **OpenAI**: paste your API key and click Save.
- For **Kimi**: paste your Moonshot API key and click Save.
- For a **local model**: enter your server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1`) and model name.

Click **Test Connection** to verify everything works. That's it - you're ready to go.

### 4. Analyze your first image

- Upload evidence by dragging it into the upload area (E01, VMDK, VHD, raw images, ZIP, 7z, tar), or switch to **Path Mode** and enter the file path for large images or directories.
- To analyze multiple systems, click **Add Image** to add more evidence sources to the same case. Each image is labeled and processed independently.
- AIFT opens each image or Triage Package.
- Select artifacts manually or click **Recommended**. Each image has its own artifact tab with OS-specific options. Use **Apply to All** to replicate a selection across all images. You can also save and load artifact profiles.
- Click **Parse**. Per-image progress is shown in real time.
- Enter your investigation context (e.g., "Suspected unauthorized access between Jan 1-15, 2026. Look for new accounts and remote access tools. IOC identified: abc.exe").
- Click **Analyze**. Per-artifact findings stream in for each image, followed by per-image summaries and (for multi-image cases) a cross-system correlation identifying lateral movement, shared IOCs, and incident timeline across all systems.
- Download the HTML report and/or the raw CSV data.
- **Chat with the AI** about the results - ask follow-up questions, request correlations, or drill into specific artifacts without re-running the analysis.

---

## AI Chat (Q&A)

After analysis completes, click **Show Chat** on the Results page to ask follow-up questions, request cross-artifact correlations, or drill into specific CSV data - the AI references its own prior analysis and automatically retrieves matching rows when needed. 

---

## AI Providers

AIFT supports four AI backends and can be run completely isolated. All configuration is done through the in-app settings page.

| Provider | What You Need | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | Recommended for analysis quality |
| **OpenAI / GPT** | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) | GPT-4o or later |
| **Kimi** | API key from [platform.moonshot.ai](https://platform.moonshot.ai) | Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 - OpenAI-compatible |
| **Local model** | Any OpenAI-compatible server | Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, text-generation-webui |

### Ollama (local, free, private)

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:70b
ollama serve
```

In AIFT settings: select **Local**, set URL to `http://localhost:11434/v1`, model to `llama3.1:70b`.

**Important: set `Analysis Max Tokens` to match your model's context window** (Settings > Advanced). For example, `qwen3:8b` with 32K context → set to `32000`. Cloud models (Claude, OpenAI, Kimi) default to 128K and typically don't need adjustment.

When an artifact's data exceeds the context budget, AIFT automatically **chunks** the CSV across multiple AI calls so every row is analyzed. Chunk findings are then merged hierarchically - grouped into batches that fit the context window, merged by the AI, and repeated until a single result remains. This ensures no data is lost regardless of model size. The maximum number of merge rounds before fallback can be configured via `Max Merge Rounds` in advanced settings (default: 5).

A minimum of 32K tokens is strongly recommended.

### Environment variables

API keys can also be set via environment variables instead of the UI:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export KIMI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

---

## Supported Artifacts

AIFT uses [Dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect) by Fox-IT (NCC Group) for forensic parsing - pure Python, no external dependencies. The OS type is detected automatically when the image is opened.

### Windows (25 artifacts)

| Category | Artifacts |
|----------|----------|
| **Persistence** | Run/RunOnce Keys, Scheduled Tasks, Services, WMI Persistence |
| **Execution** | Shimcache, Amcache, Prefetch, BAM/DAM, UserAssist, MUIcache |
| **Event Logs** | Windows Event Logs (all channels), Defender Logs |
| **File System** | NTFS MFT, USN Journal, Recycle Bin |
| **User Activity** | Browser History, Browser Downloads, PowerShell History, Activities Cache |
| **Network** | SRUM Network Data, SRUM Application Usage |
| **Registry** | Shellbags, USB Device History |
| **Security** | SAM User Accounts, Defender Quarantine |

### Linux (19 artifacts)

| Category | Artifacts |
|----------|----------|
| **Persistence** | Cron Jobs, Systemd Services |
| **Shell History** | Bash History, Zsh History, Fish History, Python History |
| **Authentication** | Login Records (wtmp), Failed Logins (btmp), Last Login, User Accounts, Groups, Sudoers Config |
| **Network** | Network Interfaces |
| **Logs** | Syslog, Systemd Journal, Package History |
| **SSH** | SSH Authorized Keys, SSH Known Hosts |

Only artifacts present in the image are shown. Unavailable artifacts are automatically grayed out.

---

## Supported Evidence Formats

AIFT uses [Dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect) for evidence loading, which supports a wide range of forensic image and disk formats.

| Category | Formats | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **EnCase (EWF)** | `.E01`, `.Ex01`, `.S01`, `.L01` | Split segments (`.E02`, `.E03`, ...) are auto-discovered in the same directory |
| **Raw / DD** | `.dd`, `.img`, `.raw`, `.bin`, `.iso` | Bit-for-bit disk images |
| **Split raw** | `.000`, `.001`, ... | Segmented raw images - pass the first segment |
| **VMware** | `.vmdk`, `.vmx`, `.vmwarevm` | Virtual disk and VM config (auto-loads associated disks) |
| **Hyper-V** | `.vhd`, `.vhdx`, `.vmcx` | Legacy and modern Hyper-V formats |
| **VirtualBox** | `.vdi`, `.vbox` | VirtualBox disk and VM config |
| **QEMU** | `.qcow2`, `.utm` | QEMU Copy-On-Write and UTM bundles |
| **Parallels** | `.hdd`, `.hds`, `.pvm`, `.pvs` | Parallels Desktop images |
| **OVA / OVF** | `.ova`, `.ovf` | Open Virtualization Format |
| **XenServer** | `.xva`, `.vma` | Xen and Proxmox exports |
| **Backup** | `.vbk` | Veeam Backup files |
| **Dissect native** | `.asdf`, `.asif` | Dissect `acquire` output |
| **FTK / AccessData** | `.ad1` | Logical images |
| **Archives** | `.zip`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz` | Extracted and scanned for evidence files inside |

Evidence can also be provided as a **directory path** (e.g., KAPE or Velociraptor triage output for Windows, or UAC triage output for Linux).

For images over 2 GB, use **Path Mode** instead of uploading - enter the local file path and AIFT reads it directly.

---

## Multi-Image Analysis

AIFT supports analyzing multiple evidence sources in a single case - for example, a workstation, a server, and a domain controller from the same incident.

- **Add images** to a case using the **Add Image** button on the evidence page. Each image gets its own label, metadata summary, and hash verification.
- **Per-image artifact selection** with tabbed UI. Select different artifacts for each image based on OS type and investigative focus. Use **Apply Recommended to All** or **Apply Current Selection to All** to bulk-configure artifacts across images.
- **Parallel parsing** with independent per-image progress tracking via SSE.
- **Three-phase AI analysis:**
  1. Per-artifact analysis for each image (same pipeline as single-image).
  2. Per-image cross-artifact summary.
  3. **Cross-system correlation** - the AI identifies lateral movement paths, shared accounts, network connections between systems, a multi-system timeline, patient zero assessment, and shared IOCs across all images.
- **Reports** include per-image evidence summaries with individual hash verification, per-image findings sections, and a dedicated cross-system analysis panel.
- **Chat** context includes findings from all images for cross-system follow-up questions.
- **CSV downloads** are organized into subdirectories by image label.

Single-image cases work exactly as before - the multi-image features activate only when multiple images are added.

---

## Roadmap

Features under active development:

- **CLI and API Support**: Support for a headless CLI mode and the usage of API's for automations. 
- **Mobile Support**: iOS and Android device analysis using [iLEAPP](https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP) and [ALEAPP](https://github.com/abrignoni/ALEAPP). Covers call logs, SMS, browser history, installed apps, location data, and more.

---

## Forensic Integrity

AIFT is built with forensic defensibility in mind:

- **Evidence is read-only.** Disk images are never modified. Dissect opens everything in read-only mode.
- **SHA-256 + MD5 hashing** on intake and before report generation (can be skipped in Settings → Advanced for faster intake of large images). Hash match is verified and shown in the report.
- **Complete audit trail.** Every action (upload, parse, analyze, report) is logged with UTC timestamps to a per-case `audit.jsonl` file.
- **AI guardrails.** The AI is instructed to cite specific records, state uncertainty explicitly, and never fabricate evidence. Findings include confidence ratings (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW).
- **Prompt audit trail.** Every prompt sent to the AI (system prompt + user prompt) is saved to the case's `prompts/` directory. This allows full review of exactly what the AI was asked, regardless of provider.
- **Disclaimer in every report.** AI-assisted findings must be verified by a qualified examiner before use in legal or formal proceedings.

---

## Report Output

AIFT generates a **self-contained HTML report** - all CSS inlined, no external dependencies. Open it in any browser, print it, or archive it. The report includes:

- Evidence metadata and hash verification (per-image in multi-image cases)
- Executive summary with confidence assessment
- Per-artifact findings with cited evidence
- Cross-system analysis panel (multi-image cases)
- Investigation gaps and recommended next steps
- Complete audit trail

Parsed artifact data is also available as a downloadable CSV bundle for further analysis (organized by image label in multi-image cases).

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10-3.13
- Python 3.14+ is currently unsupported due to upstream `dissect.target` compatibility
- 8 GB RAM minimum (for parsing large artifacts)
- Disk space: ~2× the evidence file size (for parsed CSV output)
- No C library dependencies - Dissect is pure Python

---

## Disclaimer

AIFT output is AI-assisted. All findings must be independently verified by a qualified forensic examiner before use in any legal, regulatory, or formal investigative proceeding. The AI analyzes only the data provided and may not capture all relevant artifacts or context.

When using a cloud-based AI provider, parsed artifact data is sent to external servers for analysis. Be mindful of the sensitivity of the evidence - if the data is subject to privacy regulations, legal restrictions, or confidentiality requirements, consider using a local model instead.
