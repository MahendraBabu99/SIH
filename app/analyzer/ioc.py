"""IOC extraction and prompt-building helpers for the forensic analyzer.

Extracts Indicators of Compromise (URLs, IPs, domains, hashes, emails,
file paths, filenames, suspicious tool keywords) from investigation context
text, and formats them into prompt sections for AI analysis.

Includes false-positive filtering to avoid misidentifying GUIDs as hashes
and filenames/version strings as domain names.

Attributes:
    _GUID_HEX_RE: Compiled regex matching 32-char GUID-shaped hex strings.
