"""Upload handling and evidence path resolution for evidence intake.

Handles collecting uploaded files from Flask requests, stream-saving with
size limits, resolving split-image segment groups, determining Dissect
target paths, normalising user-supplied paths, and archive extraction
dispatch.

Attributes:
    EWF_SEGMENT_RE: Compiled regex for EWF split segment filenames.
    SPLIT_RAW_SEGMENT_RE: Compiled regex for split raw disk image segments.
    SAVE_CHUNK_SIZE: Byte size of chunks used when stream-saving uploads.
